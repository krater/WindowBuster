   Long times ago, as i suddenly understood the MS Windows messaging system, 
   i build a little tool to play around with the windows from running applications. 
   You can play around with the window settings, change text, etc...

   It's pre Alpha ! I only did play around with the possibilities. It was never planned 
   as productive software. Press the wrong button to the wrong time and it will crash.
